    Assignment: Apply a given annotation scheme to a source text.
                        
    I will show you a **source text** and an argument map. Your task is to annotate the **source text** in order to highlight the argumentative function of different parts in the text. The argument map is merely supposed to help you with this task.

    The source text to be annotated is:
           
    ::: {{.source_text}}
    {sources}
    :::

    The {qualifier}argument map which sketches the source text's argumentative structure:

    {argdown_snippet}

    Use the following schema to annotate the source text above:

    {annotation_scheme}

    In particular:           

    1. Just add tags and attributes to the source text to mark the argumentative function of each part. Don't modify the text in any other way (exception: non-annotated segments of long texts may be shortened).                        
    2. Use the `argument_label` attribute to relate the annotated text segments to the given informal argument map.
    3. Enclose the annotated text in a single fenced codeblock, starting with '```xml' and ending with '```'.

    Hello there! Today we're going to be text detectives! üîç

    I have a story AND a map of the arguments in the story. Your job is to find and mark all the important parts in the story that match the map!

    First, here's the story we need to work on:

    ::: {{.source_text}}
    {sources}
    :::

    Now, here's the {qualifier}argument map that shows how all the ideas connect:

    {argdown_snippet}

    Your mission is to add special tags to the story that show where each part of the argument is! Use these special tags:

    {annotation_scheme}

    Here's how to complete your mission:

    1. Look at the argument map to see what claims and arguments are there
    2. Find those same ideas in the story
    3. Put <proposition> tags around each important idea you find 
    4. Give each one a special ID (like "1", "2", etc.)
    5. If one idea supports another, use the "supports" tag to show that!
    6. If one idea attacks another, use the "attacks" tag to show that!
    7. Optionally, you may add an "argument_label" for each part that matches what it's called in the map

    When you're done, put your work between these special markers:
    ```xml
    (your marked-up text goes here)
    ```

    And remember, don't change any of the words in the story - just add the tags around them!

    I know you can do this! Good luck, detective! üåü

    Hey there! I need your help with something that's perfect for your skills.

    I've got this text and an argument map someone created for it. What I need you to do is basically "connect the dots" between them - annotate the original text to show where each part of the argument map comes from.

    Here's the text:

    ::: {{.source_text}}
    {sources}
    :::

    And here's the {qualifier}argument map that was created from it:

    {argdown_snippet}

    Could you add XML tags to the original text to show where each argument and claim from the map appears? Here's the annotation scheme to use:

    {annotation_scheme}

    Optionally, you may document that your annotation and the map align nicely: For each bit you tag with <proposition>, add an "argument_label" attribute that matches the label in the map (like [claim1] or <argument1>).

    Don't change any of the text itself - just add the tags. If there are super long sections that don't contain arguments, you can shorten those with [...].

    When you're done, just wrap everything in a code block starting with ```xml and ending with ```.

    This would be super helpful - thanks!

    PROCEDURAL CONTEXT:
    This protocol outlines a two-stage annotation procedure in which text segments are marked according to their argumentative function using a pre-established argument map as reference.
    
    SOURCE MATERIALS:
    
    Document A (Source Text for Annotation):
    ::: {{.source_text}}

    METHODOLOGICAL PROCEDURE:
    
    I. Text Segmentation Parameters
       A. Identify text segments corresponding to argumentative elements in Document B
       B. Demarcate segments using <proposition> tags
       C. Assign unique identifier attributes to each segment
       D. Preserve original text content (abbreviation permitted only for non-argumentative passages)
    
    II. Cross-Reference Heuristics (NOT REQUIRED, OPTIONAL)
       A. Establish explicit links between text segments and argument map elements
          1. Add argument_label attributes to each <proposition> element
          2. Ensure argument_label values correspond precisely to labels in Document B
       B. Document dialectical relationships between text segments
          1. Implement support relationships using "supports" attribute
          2. Implement attack relationships using "attacks" attribute
          3. Maintain consistency with relationships depicted in Document B
    
    III. Documentation Standards
       A. Maintain formal XML syntax throughout annotation
       B. Ensure proper attribute-value formatting
       C. Verify all references (IDs, argument_labels) are accurate
    
    OUTPUT FORMAT:
    Present completed annotation of Document A in a fenced code block with XML specification (```xml ... ```)
    
    This protocol ensures systematic identification of argumentative components. An explicit mapping between natural language expressions and formal argument representations is not required, but may be used as a heuristics.

    # Step-by-Step Guide: Annotating a Text Using an Argument Map

    In this exercise, you'll annotate a source text based on a pre-existing argument map. Let's break this down into manageable steps:

    ## Step 1: Understand Your Materials

    First, let's look at what you're working with:

    **Source Text** (this is what you'll annotate):
    ::: {{.source_text}}
    {sources}
    :::

    **{qualifier}Argument Map** (use this as your guide):
    {argdown_snippet}

    **Annotation Schema** (this defines how to mark up the text):
    {annotation_scheme}

    ## Step 2: Identify Key Components

    Look at the argument map and identify:
    - Each claim (in square brackets [claim])
    - Each argument (in angle brackets <argument>)
    - How they relate to each other (support/attack relationships)

    ## Step 3: Find Matching Text

    For each element in the argument map:
    1. Find the corresponding text in the source document
    2. Note where each claim and argument appears in the original text

    ## Step 4: Apply XML Tags

    For each piece of text you identified:
    1. Wrap it in `<proposition>` tags
    2. Add a unique `id` attribute (like "p1", "p2")
    3. Optionally, add an `argument_label` attribute that matches its label in the map
    4. If it supports other propositions, add a `supports` attribute with their IDs
    5. If it attacks other propositions, add an `attacks` attribute with their IDs

    ## Step 5: Heuristics

    Consider:
    - Does every node in the argument map have a corresponding tagged section in your annotation?
    - Do the support/attack relationships in your annotation match those in the map?
    - Are any flaws or inconsistencies in the argument map handled gracefully?

    ## Step 6: Format Your Answer

    Place your completed annotation in a code block:
    ```xml
    (your annotated text here)
    ```

    ## Example

    If the map has `[claim1]` and your text contains "The earth is round" that matches this claim, you would annotate it as:
    ```xml
    <proposition id="s1" argument_label="claim1">The earth is round</proposition>
    ```
    where the `argument_label` is optional.

    Now, begin your annotation by working through these steps systematically, and submit your correctly formatted annotation!

       ‚Ä¢ Optional grounding: Optionally include argument_label attributes to reference argument map nodes
    
    2. CONSTRAINTS
       ‚Ä¢ Content preservation: Maintain original textual content within annotated segments
    
    3. FORMATTING
       ‚Ä¢ Encapsulation: Present annotation within a fenced code block (```xml ... ```)

    # Tutorial: Creating an Annotated Text from an Argument Map

    In this tutorial, you'll learn how to annotate a text to show its argumentative structure by using an argument map as your guide.

    ## What You'll Need

    1. **Source Text** - The text we want to annotate:
       ::: {{.source_text}}
       {sources}
       :::

    2. **{qualifier}Argument Map** - A map showing the arguments in the text:
       {argdown_snippet}

    3. **Annotation Schema** - The rules for how to annotate:
       {annotation_scheme}

    ## What We're Trying to Accomplish

    Imagine the argument map as a "blueprint" of the text's argumentative structure. Your job is to go back to the "building" (the text) and label each room according to the blueprint.

    ## Step-by-Step Process

    ### 1. Understand the Argument Map
    First, look at the argument map and note:
    - The claims (marked with [square brackets])
    - The arguments (marked with <angle brackets>)
    - How they connect (which ones support or attack others)

    ### 2. Find the Matching Text
    For each element in the map, find where it appears in the original text. Look for sentences or paragraphs that express:
    - The exact claims from the map
    - The arguments described in the map

    ### 3. Apply the Annotation
    For each matching piece of text:
    - Wrap it in `<proposition>` tags
    - Add a unique `id` attribute (e.g., "S1", "S2")
    - If it supports other propositions, list their IDs in the `supports` attribute
    - If it attacks other propositions, list their IDs in the `attacks` attribute
    - Optionally add an `argument_label` attribute matching its label in the map, to keep track of your progress

    ### 4. Example
    If your map has:
    ```
    [claim1]: The earth is round
           
    <arg1>
        +> [claim1]
    ```

    You might annotate your text as:
    ```xml
    <proposition id="S1" argument_label="claim1">The earth is round.</proposition> <proposition id="S2" argument_label="arg1" supports="S1">Scientists have proven the earth is round.</proposition>
    ```

    ### 5. Final Format
    Make sure to put your entire annotation in a code block:
    ```xml
    (your annotated text here)
    ```

    Remember: Don't change the words in the text - just add the tags around them. If there are long non-argumentative sections, you can shorten them with [...].

    Now it's your turn to create your annotation!
