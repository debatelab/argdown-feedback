    Assignment: Reconstruct a source text's argumentation as an argument map.
                        
    I will show you an annotated source text. The annotation identifies the argumentative function of different text segments. Your task is to reconstruct the text's arguments as an Argdown argument map.

    ::: {{.source_text}}
    {sources}
    :::

    In particular, I ask you

    - to explicitly label all nodes in your argument map;
    - to use square/angled brackets for labels to distinguish arguments/claims;
    - to indicate support and attack relations between nodes in accordance with Argdown syntax conventions;
    - you may optionally refer, in your argument map, to text segments in the annotation through yaml inline data with an `annotation_ids` attribute that contains a list of proposition `ids`, being tolerant vis-√†-vis potential errors in the annotation.
    
    DO NOT include any detailed reconstructions of individual arguments as premise-conclusion-structures in your argdown code.

    Importantly, enclose your Argdown argument map in a single fenced codeblock, starting with '```argdown' and ending with '```'.

    Hello there! Today we're going to be map makers! üó∫Ô∏è

    I have a special text that someone has already marked up with <proposition> tags. Your job is to turn it into a cool argument map!

    Here's the marked-up text:

    ::: {{.source_text}}
    {sources}
    :::

    Now, I want you to create an Argdown map that shows how all these marked parts fit together! Here's how:

    1. Look at all the <proposition> parts in the text and their IDs
    2. Create a map with all the main ideas (claims) and arguments
    3. For claims, use [square brackets] around their labels
    4. For arguments, use <angle brackets> around their labels
    5. Show which ideas support others with +> arrows
    6. Show which ideas attack others with -> arrows
    7. For each idea in your map, optionally tell us which marked parts it comes from using {{annotation_ids: ['id1', 'id2']}}
    8. Don't worry about any errors in the original marked-up text - just focus on making a clear map!

    When you're done, put your map between these special markers:
    ```argdown
    (your map goes here)
    ```

    Just focus on making a map that shows how everything connects - don't try to rebuild each argument with premises and conclusions.

    Hey there! I've got an interesting task for you today.
                        
    I have this text that's already been annotated with proposition tags that mark the argumentative parts. What I need you to do is take that annotated text and turn it into an Argdown argument map.

    Here's the annotated text:

    ::: {{.source_text}}

    Basically, I need you to:
    - Create a representation of how all these tagged parts connect to each other (using Argdown syntax)

    - Show which parts support or attack other parts
    - For each node in your map, you may include {{annotation_ids: ['id1', 'id2']}} to show which tagged parts in the original text it corresponds to

    Don't break down the individual arguments into premises and conclusions - just focus on the big picture of how everything relates.

    When you're done, just put your map in a code block starting with ```argdown and ending with ```.

    # Creating an Argument Map from an Annotated Text: Step-by-Step Guide

    In this exercise, you'll transform an annotated text into an Argdown argument map. Let's break this down into simple steps:

    ## Step 1: Analyze the Annotated Text
    First, carefully examine the text with its proposition tags:

    ::: {{.source_text}}
    {sources}
    :::

    Pay special attention to:
    - The `id` attributes of each proposition
    - The `supports` and `attacks` attributes that show relationships
    - Any existing `argument_label` attributes

    ## Step 2: Identify the Components
    Make a list of:
    - All the main claims in the text
    - All the arguments that support or attack these claims
    - How these elements relate to each other

    ## Step 3: Create Your Map Structure
    Now, start building your map:
    1. Create nodes for each main claim using [square brackets]
    2. Create nodes for each argument using <angle brackets>
    3. Give each node a descriptive label

    ## Step 4: Establish Relationships
    Add the connections between nodes:
    - Use `+>` arrows to show support relationships
    - Use `->` arrows to show attack relationships

    ## Step 5 (Optional): Add Cross-References
    For each node in your map, add metadata showing which proposition(s) from the original text it corresponds to:
    ```
    {{annotation_ids: ['p1', 'p2']}}
    ```

    ## Step 6: Review Your Map
    Check that:
    - Every proposition from the annotated text is represented
    - All relationships match those in the annotation
    - Your map uses proper Argdown syntax
    - Any errors in the annotation are handled gracefully

    ## Step 7: Format Your Answer
    Put your completed map in a code block:
    ```argdown
    (your argument map here)
    ```

    Remember: Focus on the relationships between arguments and claims, not the internal structure of individual arguments.

    ARGUMENTATIVE STRUCTURE VISUALIZATION PROTOCOL

    VISUALIZATION PARAMETERS:

    1. NODE EXTRACTION
       ‚Ä¢ Primary elements: Identify all <proposition> components from source annotation
       ‚Ä¢ Classification schema:

         - Attack: -> / <- notation

    3. METADATA INTEGRATION (OPTIONAL)
       ‚Ä¢ Cross-reference system: Every node linked to source propositions
       ‚Ä¢ Identification preservation: Maintain original IDs in annotation_ids attributes
       ‚Ä¢ Relationship fidelity: Dialectical relations in visualization must match source annotation

    OUTPUT FORMAT:
    Present visualization as structured Argdown code within fenced block:

    # Tutorial: Creating an Argument Map from an Annotated Text

    In this tutorial, you'll learn how to transform a text that already has argumentative annotations into a clear argument map using Argdown notation.

    ## What You're Starting With

    You have a text where the argumentative parts have been marked with <proposition> tags:

    ::: {{.source_text}}
    {sources}
    :::

    ## What You'll Create

    You'll create an Argdown argument map that shows how all the identified propositions relate to each other in a visual structure.

    ## Why This Matters

    Converting from annotations to an argument map helps us:
    - See the big picture of how arguments connect
    - Visualize which claims are supported or attacked
    - Understand the overall argumentative structure
    - Uncover flaws in the annotation and handle them gracefully

    ## The Transformation Process

    ### 1. Understanding the Annotation
    
    First, look at what information the annotation provides:
    - Each `<proposition>` has a unique `id`
    - Some propositions `support` others
    - Some propositions `attack` others

    ### 2. Planning Your Map

    Based on these relationships:
    - Identify which propositions should be claims [in square brackets]
    - Identify which propositions should be arguments <in angle brackets>
    - Note which ones support or attack others

    ### 3. Creating Your Argument Map

    Now, build your map using Argdown syntax. Note that the yaml inline data is optional but helpful for cross-referencing:

    ```argdown
    // Claims with references to annotation IDs
    [claim1]: First major claim {{annotation_ids: ['p1']}}
    
    // Arguments with references to annotation IDs
    <arg1>: Supporting argument {{annotation_ids: ['p2']}}
    
    // Support and attack relationships
    <arg1>
        +> [claim1]
    ```

    ### 4. Adding Cross-References (Optional)

    For each node in your map, you may include the `annotation_ids` attribute that shows which proposition(s) in the original text it corresponds to.

    ## Your Task

    Now, create your own argument map based on the annotated text. Remember to:
    - Create nodes for all important propositions
    - Use the right bracket style for claims and arguments
    - Show all support and attack relationships
    - Put your map in a code block with ```argdown at the start and ``` at the end

    Good luck with your argument mapping!
