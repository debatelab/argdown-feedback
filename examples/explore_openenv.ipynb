      "\n",
      "**Background**\n",
      "\n",
      "Around seven out of ten Americans (72%) use social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Pinterest, up from 26% in 2008. [26] [189]. On social media sites, users may develop biographical profiles, communicate with friends and strangers, do research, and share thoughts, photos, music, links, and more.\n",
      "Proponents of social networking sites say that the online communities promote increased interaction with friends and family; offer teachers, librarians, and students valuable access to educational support and materials; facilitate social and political change; and disseminate useful information rapidly.\n",
      "Opponents of social networking say that the sites prevent face-to-face communication; waste time on frivolous activity; alter children’s brains and behavior making them more prone to ADHD; expose users to predators like pedophiles and burglars; and spread false and potentially dangerous information. Read more background…\n",
      "\n",
      "**Debate**\n",
      "\n",
      "Social media posts cannot be completely deleted and all information posted can have unintended consequences.\n",
      "The Library of Congress has been archiving all public tweets from Twitter’s Mar. 2006 inception forward.  Information about an affair posted on Facebook, for example, can lead to and be used against someone in divorce proceedings because the information, once posted, can never be completely deleted. 81% of members of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers (AAML) said that they have seen in a rise in the use of social media as evidence in divorce proceedings with Facebook being cited as the primary source in 66% of divorce cases.\n",
      "Social media sites empower individuals to make social change and do social good on a community level.\n",
      "Social media shares popularized nine-year old Scottish student, Martha Payne, and her blog, “Never Seconds,” which exposed the state of her school’s lunch program prompting international attention that resulted in changes to her school and the formation of “Friends of Never Seconds” charity to feed children globally.  Jeannette Van Houten uses social media to find owners of photographs and mementos strewn from houses by Hurricane Sandy.  Hillsborough, CA, freshman varsity soccer goalie Daniel Cui was blamed for and bullied about a losing season until over 100 of his teammates and classmates changed their Facebook profile photos to one of Cui making a save, silencing the bullies and building Cui’s confidence.\n",
      "Social media facilitates political change.\n",
      "Social media gives social movements a quick, no-cost method to organize, disseminate information, and mobilize people.  Students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, used social media to mobilize a gun control movement following a deadly shooting at their school. The student activists used Twitter to promote nationwide protests on Mar. 24, 2018 that drew over one million participants and registered thousands of new voters.  The 2011 Egyptian uprising (part of the Arab Spring), organized largely via social media, motivated tens of thousands of protestors and ultimately led to the resignation of Egyptian President Mubarak on Feb. 11, 2011.  A July 4, 2011 tweet from @Adbusters with the hashtag #occupywallstreet started the American Occupy movement.  In 2015, the Black Lives Matter grassroots campaign addressed racism and police brutality in the United States and successfully pressured the 2016 presidential candidates to publicly address the issue.\n",
      "Unauthorized sharing on social media exposes artists to copyright infringement, loss of intellectual property, and loss of income.\n",
      "According to Business Insider, “illegally uploaded videos routinely clock up tens of millions of views, and hundreds of thousands of shares” with profits going to those who shared the content rather than those whose created it.  YouTube vloggers report that unauthorized sharing of their videos on Facebook is costing them millions of dollars in lost profits with one reporting $20,000 in lost profits from just one video.  Photographer Daniel Morel was awarded $1.2M in damages after Getty Images and AFP were found to have willfully infringed his copyright by selling photos he had posted on social media without his permission.\n",
